## Why I find this interesting
The article presents a product called Convex, a cutting-edge backend framework constructed on top of React, offering a serverless approach to software developmnent. What sets it apart is that is doesn't just provide a cloud database for developers; it also delivers an extensive range of server functions and addtional backend capabilities. Leveraging a cloud-based platform like Convex eliminates the need for developers to manage their own infrastructure. 

## Comment from Kevin Huang(ch3936)
This article discusses the enduring popularity of React, the rising popularity of serverless backend platforms and a new product, Convex. It's interesting to learn about the rise of serverless backend platforms and their potential to streamline backend development, allowing developers to focus more on frontend and user experience. The author also led us to explore various methods for managing state in React applications when working with non-reactive backends and introduces serverless backend platforms as a solution to bridge the gap between frontend and backend development.
